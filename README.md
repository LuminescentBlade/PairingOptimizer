# PairingOptimizer
optimize fates pairings here

Usage:

Put in some weights to each character in the textboxes, or use the drag and drop sort option per character on the sidebar
Don't hit optimize until you at least give each character 2-5 weighted options because this runs on Djikstra's algorithm and really doesn't like it if you try to do it as an unweighted graph and may crash
